# How do I approach designing software?

When it comes to designing software, I approach the process with a blend of creativity and structure. Throughout the course of this project, I've honed several new design skills that have significantly enriched my approach. One key skill is the ability to create a coherent and aesthetically pleasing 3D scene by carefully selecting and placing objects. This involved not only understanding the technical aspects of OpenGL but also considering the visual and user experience aspects of the scene. My design process for this project was systematic yet flexible. I began by outlining the core features and functionalities I wanted to implement and then translated them into a rough design. As I progressed, I continually refined this design through iterative cycles, incorporating feedback and adjusting as needed. The ability to adapt and refine my design was crucial in ensuring that the final 3D scene met my initial vision.

# How do I approach developing programs?

Developing programs, especially in the context of my 3D scene, required a strategic approach that I've developed over time. As I delved into this project, I embraced new development strategies to enhance efficiency and maintainability. One strategy was modular programming, breaking down the codebase into smaller, manageable components. This not only made the development process more organized but also allowed me to reuse certain functions across the codebase, promoting efficiency. Iteration was a cornerstone of my development process. I recognized the value of building a basic version of the scene first and then incrementally adding features and improvements. This iterative approach not only helped me catch and rectify errors early on but also enabled me to maintain a clear sense of progress.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The field of computer science, particularly computational graphics and visualizations, holds immense potential in aiding me in reaching my goals. Educationally, these areas equip me with a unique set of skills that extend beyond theoretical knowledge. Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience in translating complex mathematical concepts into practical implementations, enhancing my problem-solving skills. This experience lays a strong foundation for further exploration in computer science, giving me the confidence to tackle more intricate challenges. Professionally, the skills I've acquired in this project align with the demand for innovative visual solutions in various industries. Whether it's creating interactive simulations, data visualizations, or even virtual reality applications, the knowledge I've gained opens doors to diverse opportunities where I can contribute creatively and analytically.
